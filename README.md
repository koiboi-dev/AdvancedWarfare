Ever wanted a long-range solution to the destruction of a minecraft base? Ever wanted to recreate the stunning images of
SAM missiles intercepting rockets?
MissileWarfare provides both of those, and more.
This Slimefun addon adds the following (amazing) features to your (wonderful) server.

- SSM: Surface-to-Surface Missiles
    - Small, medium, large and advanced missiles with Normal, Accurate, Long-Range and High-Explosive types!
    - Anti-Radiation Missiles (ARM) fly like a normal SSM until it finds a radar, where it will fly directly into it
      and (hopefully) destroy it! (Coming soon)
    - Extremely long range ICBMs!
    - Napalm, Sticky Missile, Gas Missile and some other misc. missiles!
- SAM: Surface-to-Air Missiles
    - Anti-Elytra Missiles (AEM) lock onto players flying with Elytras, and shoot them down!
    - Missile Interceptors well... Intercept missiles as they detect them, and shoot them down!
- Radars & Displays (coming soon)

## Integrations (Soft Depends)

- **Towny:** Checks if the person nearest to the missile at the time of its launch was an enemy of the town where the
  explosion has happened. If they aren't, the explosion is cancelled.
- **Worldguard:** Adds flag `ALLOW_MISSILE_EXPLODE`.
